# The available ground truth state measurements can be accessed by calling sensor_data[item]. All values of "item" are provided as defined in main.py within the function read_sensors. 
# The "item" values that you may later retrieve for the hardware project are:
# "x_global": Global X position
# "y_global": Global Y position
# "z_global": Global Z position
# 'v_x": Global X velocity
# "v_y": Global Y velocity
# "v_z": Global Z velocity
# "ax_global": Global X acceleration
# "ay_global": Global Y acceleration
# "az_global": Global Z acceleration (With gravtiational acceleration subtracted)
# "roll": Roll angle (rad)
# "pitch": Pitch angle (rad)
# "yaw": Yaw angle (rad)
# "q_x": X Quaternion value
# "q_y": Y Quaternion value
# "q_z": Z Quaternion value
# "q_w": W Quaternion value
